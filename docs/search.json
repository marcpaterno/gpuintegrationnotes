      "description": "This is a blog about exploring multidimensional numerical integration on GPUs.\nIt describes work is done as part of the Fermi National Accelerator\nLaboratory's LDRD project \"Numerical Integration on GPUs\" (LDRD 2020-050).\n\nThis is the place where we keep \"working notes\" for the project.\nThese working notes are always a work-in-progress for a research project,\nand emphatically are *not* the final publishable project results.",
