title: "About this blog"
description: |
  This is a blog about exploring multidimensional numerical integration on GPUs.
  It describes work is done as part of the Fermi National Accelerator
  Laboratory's LDRD project "Numerical Integration on GPUs" (LDRD 2020-050).
  
  This is the place where we keep "working notes" for the project.
  These working notes are always a work-in-progress for a research project,
  and emphatically are *not* the final publishable project results.
