This will be the place where we post articles describing the work on our
laboratory-directed research and development project "Numerical Integration on
GPUs" (LDRD-2020-050). This project is supported by the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory's LDRD program.

The research is being conducted by:

* Dr. Marc Paterno (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory)
* Ioannis Sakiotis (Old Dominion University)
* Prof. Desh Ranjan (Old Dominion University)
* Prof. Balsa Terzoc (Old Dominion University)
* Prof. Mohammad Zubair (Old Dominion University)
