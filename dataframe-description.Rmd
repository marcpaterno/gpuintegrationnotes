1. *alg*: the name of the algorithm
2. *epsrel*: the fractional error target
3. *value*: the estimated value of the integral
4. *errorest*: the estimated error for the result
5. *error*: the absolute difference between the estimated value and the true value
6. *neval*: the number of function evaluations used
7. *nregions*: the number of regions used
8. *time*: the time in milliseconds for the calculation
9. *r*: ratio of (errorest/(epsrel*value)); this should be less than 1 if the algorithm has converged
10. *converged*: boolean showing whether r < 1

A value of NA indicates that the algorithm did not converge,
but rather stopped because the maximum number of function evaluations had been reached.
